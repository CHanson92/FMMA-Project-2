# FMMA - Find My Martial Arts Gym Project

This is my project 2 from the App Development course at RED Academy, this is an individual project that we were allowed to work on. In this project I have used Meteor.js, React, HTML/CSS/SASS and MongoDB as my database. 

The idea for this project comes from my hobby of martial arts, in that it can be difficult to find a martial arts gym near you partiuclarly if you are travelling as people tend to post on forums or look online atr old websites that people haven't updated in a long time. I decided to design this app so somebody can find their closest martial arts gym based on their location.

## Built With

* [Meteor.js] - The web framework used.
* [React] - Used to render the frontend of the project.
* [MongoDB] - Used as the database.
* [FuseJS] - Search functionality framework.
